Debugging

Two events that lead to debugging:
-error: your code doesn't run
  * common types, common solutions 
-failure: your code runs, but gives an unexpected result
  * anything goes; no standard 

**Have a Process!**
1. read your ERRORS (entire error) 
2. read your stack trace
3. verify your assumptions
4. try things (research)
